Flexible PTO – Unlimited paid time off, which allows team members to take the time they need for vacation or illness so they can return to work able to contribute fully to our mission. The foundation recognizes 11 paid national holidays per year and may also announce closure for local, regional, or state holidays
Remote Work Environment - Ability to work 100% remotely, but not alone - with mature, socially minded professionals
Wellness Support – Access to Ginger, Gympass, Headspace, and SmartSpend Plus, along with financial well-being providers
Parental Leave – Up to 6 months of gender-neutral paid leave for parents and caregivers when they have a new addition to their families
Learning Reimbursements – Foundation policy encouraging employees to explore development opportunities such as peer learning, internal trainings, and external activities; savings on student loans (available via insurance provider)

About Harvest
Harvest is an industry-leading, independent software company that makes tools to help businesses run more smoothly. We believe that businesses only succeed by using their time intentionally. Our products support our customers through time tracking, reporting, and forecasting features.
Harvest started in 2006 as a team of three and has grown to today’s current team of almost 90 with Harvesters working from around the globe. We’ve worked as a remote team since the beginning and we continue to hire the right people for the job no matter where they call home.
We strive to create a workplace culture where everyone feels valued, included, and heard. One important aspect of this is continuing to create spaces for diverse life experiences and work histories. If you are a member of a group that is historically underrepresented and disadvantaged in tech, business, and society in general, we want to meet you and we encourage you to apply.
Why We’re Hiring
We are looking for a Data Analyst to uplevel Harvest’s business and product insights, developing reporting and data visualizations that inform strategic decisions throughout the entire Harvest organization.
In this role, you will leverage your technical skills to synthesize and analyze data, then present your findings via clear and consumable reporting that ensures understanding and elevates data literacy.
To be successful in this role, you must be an exceptional communicator, capable of translating complex ideas into actionable insights and presenting to all levels of the organization. You must have strong technical abilities, with expertise in SQL, Python and R combined with strong analytical skills.

Synthesize data from a variety of sources to develop and present reporting and data visualizations that drive understanding and inform action for Harvesters at every level of the organization.
Leverage your extensive SQL knowledge to query and analyze data; when more advanced analysis is required, use Python or R to explore, visualize and analyze data while codifying business logic using DBT (Data Build Tool) and automating reports using Mode, our BI tool of choice.
Cultivate a nuanced understanding of Harvest’s data and lead research to uncover the questions we don’t know we should be asking, both for our business and product.
Improve our data systems by collaborating with colleagues across Harvest to continue to expand and centralize our knowledge into DBT while ensuring stakeholders understand how to access this knowledge.
Requirements
Appetite and effort to stay up to date on the latest trends
Strong attention to detail with an analytical mind to problem-solve
Excellent written and verbal communication skills
Proven ability to visualize data in a way that increases understanding
Ability to work independently with minimal supervision while delivering results
Fluency in SQL and an added benefit if comfortable with a scripting language (preference for Python/R)
Benefits
At Harvest, our compensation consists of three main components:
A competitive base pay: The salary for this role is $165,000 in USD. Every Harvester with the same role expectations receives the same base pay. And we aim to pay at the top of the market (informed by third-party data) for all roles.
Individual and company performance bonus plans: We believe in rewarding performance, so all Harvesters are eligible to receive an individual and company performance bonus after working with Harvest for a period of time.
Competitive benefits*: We offer a number of benefits, including
15 days of vacation in your first year, plus company holidays and a week off for winter break. And you’ll get an additional two days per year until you reach twenty days.

However, the last key component, data, largely remains trapped behind barriers of regulation, privacy, schema standards and competitive risk. Enabling scalable access to data will unlock enormous value for both individual developers and companies. This has only been made possible in the last few years, through advances in manifold learning algorithms and privacy-preserving computing. See our blog for more details.

One of the most valuable kinds of data today is in the financial sector. Financial data plays a key role across many industry verticals. However, it has notoriously been locked behind regulatory barriers and a lack of format standards. Our end product is an API that makes financial transactions accessible to both humans and machine-learning models, in a scalable and privacy-preserving way.

We
- come from various fields - engineering, mathematics, physics and arts.
- are allergic to over-engineering.
- are anarchists at heart and like to hack around the status quo.
love playing board and video games.
- are radically honest and appreciate challenging one another, rather than giving out “pats on the back”. Yet, we can always rely on each other for support, feedback and results.
- are willing to learn and adapt quickly to new situations and requirements. Languages, frameworks, libraries, compilers, etc. are just tools for a job. A new problem might need a new tool. If it doesn’t exist yet, we will build it.
- have a sense of humor (well, we think we do).

As an early member of our data science team, you will help
- push the limits of what can be done with data.
- build the team and drive the direction of the company.
- shape our product and culture.
- experience the direct impact of what you build on hundreds of millions of people’s financial lives.
